# Contributing to Shiploader [suggestion-not-validated]

## Welcome to the contribute guidelines

_NOTE: The following contributing.md was inspired in Atom's guideline._

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Shiploader and its packages, which are hosted in the [Webera](https://github.com/wearewebera) on GitHub. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.



## What should I know before I get started?



####  Conventions

There are a few conventions that have developed over time around packages:

* Pull requests that adds new features must be highlited in way to be clear, _e.g_:
    * new feature include Go-lang code, so package must be: `[Go] feature-that-I-did`
* Pull requests that add one or more syntax highlighting grammars are named `language-[language-name]`
    * Language packages can add other things besides just a grammar. Many offer commonly-used snippets. Try not to add too much though.
* Theme packages are split into two categories: UI and Syntax themes
    * UI themes are named `[theme-name]-ui`
    * Syntax themes are named `[theme-name]-syntax`
    * Often themes that are designed to work together are given the same root name, for example: `one-dark-ui` and `one-dark-syntax`
    * UI themes style everything outside of the editor pane &mdash; all of the green areas in the [packages image above](#atom-packages-image)
    * Syntax themes style just the items inside the editor pane, mostly syntax highlighting
* Packages that add [autocomplete providers](https://github.com/atom/autocomplete-plus/wiki/Autocomplete-Providers) are named `autocomplete-[what-they-autocomplete]` &mdash; ex: [autocomplete-css](https://github.com/atom/autocomplete-css)
